# CONFIDENTIAL6G

[CONFIDENTIAL6G](https://confidential6g.eu/about-confidential6g/) is a research project built on three foundational pillars: **post-quantum and privacy-preserving cryptography**, **confidential computing**, and **confidential communication**.

The project aims to develop tools, libraries, and blueprints to ensure confidentiality in 6G networks. These include cryptographic enablers as the foundation for building advanced software components, platforms, and applications that enhance secure communication and computing. Key innovations include:

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)** and **Federated AI/ML Orchestration**
- **Advanced cryptographic protocols resistant to quantum computing attacks**
- **Formal security proofs to ensure the highest levels of security**

This document highlights a collection of open-source tools developed by our partners during the project, encouraging the community to use these results in building and integrating **confidential 6G infrastructure**.

## Aloha-HE

This repository provides the source code of Aloha-HE, a hardware accelerator for client-side operations in homomorphic encryption. Aloha-HE targets the CKKS scheme and supports all operations required during encode+encrypt and decode+decrypt in hardware. We publish the source code for the Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 and Kintex-7 FPGA platforms.

## Streams and Decentralized Identities

Streams is a protocol that facilitates the use of decentralized identities and the exchange of encrypted messages over the IOTA Tangle. It allows for the creation of secure communication channels, enabling authenticated and private data sharing between multiple parties.
